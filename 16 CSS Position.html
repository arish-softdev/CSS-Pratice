            Introduction:
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 
                CSS Position properties are used to control the positioning of elements within the layout of a web page.
            </li>
            <li>
                They provide flexibility in aligning elements relative to their parent container or the viewport.

            Key CSS Position Properties:
        </h2><ul>
            <li>
                static: The default value, where elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
            </li>
            <li>
                relative: Positions the element relative to its normal position, without affecting other elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                absolute: Positions the element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (other than static).
            </li>
            <li>
                fixed: Positions the element relative to the viewport, so it stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
            </li>
            <li>
                sticky: Behaves like a combination of relative and fixed, sticking to the viewport within a certain area.
            </li>
        </ul>
