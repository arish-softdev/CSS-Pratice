        <h3>Understanding "justify-content" in CSS Flexbox</h3>
        <p>Before we dive into the details of the "justify-content" property, let's first understand what CSS Flexbox is and how it simplifies the creation of flexible and responsive layouts in web design.</p>
    </div><br>

    <div>
        <h3>The "justify-content" Property</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>flex-start: Items are aligned at the start of the main axis.</li>
            <li>flex-end: Items are aligned at the end of the main axis.</li>
            <li>center: Items are centered along the main axis.</li>
            <li>space-between: Space is distributed between items, with no space before the first item or after the last item.</li>
            <li>space-around: Space is distributed around items, creating equal space before the first item and after the last item.</li>
            <li>space-evenly: Space is distributed evenly between items, including before the first item and after the last item.</li>
        </ol>
    </div><br>

    <div>
        <h3>1. Left-Aligned Flexbox Layout</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This code creates a flex container with `justify-content: flex-start`, aligning all flex items to the start of the container along the main axis.</li>
            <li>Each flex item has a light blue background, padding, and margin, providing visual separation and spacing between the items.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>

    </div><br>

    <div>
        <h3>2. Right-Aligned Flexbox Layout</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This code creates a flex container with `justify-content: flex-end`, aligning all flex items to the end of the container along the main axis.</li>
            <li>Each flex item has a light blue background, padding, and margin, which ensures visual separation and spacing within the container.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>

    </div><br>

    <div>
        <h3>3. Incorrect Flexbox Syntax</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This code contains incorrect syntax for the `display` and `justify-content` properties, using quotes around the values, which will prevent the styles from being applied correctly.</li>
            <li>Flex items have a light blue background with padding and margin, but due to the syntax error, the layout will not center the items as intended.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>

    </div><br>

    <div>
        <h3>4. Incorrect Flexbox Syntax with Space Between</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This code contains incorrect syntax for the `display` and `justify-content` properties, using quotes around the values, which will prevent the styles from being applied correctly.</li>
            <li>Despite the intended `justify-content: space-between`, the syntax error means the flex items will not be spaced evenly between the container's edges.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>

    </div><br>

    <div>
        <h3>5. Space Around Flex Items</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This code uses `justify-content: space-around` to distribute flex items with equal space around them, including space before the first item and after the last item.</li>
            <li>Each flex item has a light blue background, padding, and margin, which are used to create spacing and visual separation between the items.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>

    </div><br>

    <div>
        <h3>6. Even Spacing Between Flex Items</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This code sets up a flex container with `justify-content: space-evenly`, which evenly distributes the space between each item and the container's edges.</li>
            <li>Each flex item is styled with a light blue background, padding, and margin, enhancing the visual separation and even spacing within the container.</li>
        </ul>
